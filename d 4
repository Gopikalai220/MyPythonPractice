Imagine you're managing a library's book catalog stored in a Python dictionary. Each book is represented by a key (unique identifier) and a value (dictionary containing book details like title, author, etc.). You need a way to efficiently check if a new book's ID (key) already exists in the catalog before adding it to avoid duplicates.

Input Format:

Give the Key and then Value for the Key.

The first two lines represents the Key in the Dictionary.



Output Format:

Display given key already exists in a dictionary or not.


Sample Input:

3
2
20
3
30
4
40
4

Sample Output:

Enter a key to Search:

Key 4 is already present

Solution:

#Write your code here
n=int(input())
d=dict()
for i in range(0,n):
    new_key=int(input())
    new_value=int(input())
    d[new_key]=new_value
k=int(input("Enter a key to search:"))
if(k in d):
    print("Key",k,"is already present")
else:
    print("Not Exist")
