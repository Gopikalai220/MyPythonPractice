Imagine you're working on an e-commerce website. You have customer information stored in three separate dictionaries:

customer_details: This dictionary contains basic information like name, email, and phone number.cart_items: This dictionary stores the items a customer has added to their cart, including product IDs and quantities.

You need to combine these dictionaries to create a single profile for each customer that includes both their details and their cart information. This will allow you to display a more comprehensive view of each customer's activity on your website.

Input Format:

Give the Key and then Value for the Key.

The first two lines are Dictionary 1

The second two-line areDictionary 2

The Third two-line areDictionary 3



Output Format:

Key and Value in the Updated Dictionary



Sample Input:

Enter entries for dic1:
3
2
20
3
30
4
40
Enter entries for dic2:
2
5

Sample Output:

Combined dictionary: {2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 1: 10, 6: 60}

Solution:

n=int(input("Enter entries for dic1:\n"))
d=dict()
for i in range(0,n):
    new_key=int(input())
    new_value=int(input())
    d[new_key]=new_value
m=int(input("Enter entries for dic2:\n"))    
d2=dict()
for i in range(0,m):
    new_key2=int(input())
    new_value2=int(input())
    d2[new_key2]=new_value2
o=int(input("Enter entries for dic3:\n"))    
d3=dict()
for i in range(0,o):
    new_key3=int(input())
    new_value3=int(input())
    d3[new_key3]=new_value3
d4={**d,**d2,**d3}
print("Combined dictionary:",d4)
