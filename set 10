You're a botanist studying different plant species. You have a master list of all the plant species in the region (represented as a set). You're also working on specific research projects, each focusing on a subset of plants from the master list. 

Input Format:

The input will start with an integer n, the number of plant species in the master list.

The next n lines will each contain the name of a plant species (a string).

The next line will contain an integer m, the number of research projects.

For each research project, there will be:

An integer k, the number of plant species in that research project.
The next k lines will each contain the name of a plant species (a string).
Output Format:

For each research project, print the list of plant species that are part of the master list, one per line, in lexicographical order.

Sample Input:

7

Oak

Pine

Maple

Birch

Spruce

Cedar

Fir

Solution:

n=int(input())
ps1=set()
for i  in range (0,n):
    nec=input()
    ps1.add(nec)
m=int(input())

for i in range (0,m):
    rp=set()  
    mec=int(input())
    for j in range (mec):
        repla=input()
        rp.add(repla)
    li3=ps1&rp
    li4=sorted(li3)
    for i in li4:
        print(i)
